# My Projects

## Project 1: Dua's Snake Game

### Description

A console-based Snake game built in C# where the player controls a snake using arrow keys.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food. The game ends if the snake hits the wall,
bites its own tail, or if the 60 second timer runs out. Includes a main menu, instructions
page, and high score tracker.

### Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET 8.0
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

### Code Snippet

```c sharp
public static void MoveSnake()
{
(int X, int Y) newHeadPosition = (snakeX, snakeY);
snakeBody.Insert(0, newHeadPosition);

    switch (currentDirection)
    {
        case ConsoleKey.UpArrow:    snakeY--; break;
        case ConsoleKey.DownArrow:  snakeY++; break;
        case ConsoleKey.LeftArrow:  snakeX--; break;
        case ConsoleKey.RightArrow: snakeX++; break;
    }

    if (snakeX < 0 || snakeX >= gameAreaWidth ||
        snakeY < 0 || snakeY >= gameAreaHeight)
    {
        isGameOver = true;
    }

}
```

### What I Learned

- How to use lists to track the snake's body positions
- How to handle real-time keyboard input in C#
- How to draw and update graphics in the console
- How to implement a timer using DateTime
- How to structure a game loop with multiple states

## Project 2: Monthly Rainfall Calculator

### Description

A console app in C# where the user enters the total rainfall for each month of the year.
The program validates all input and uses multiple functions to calculate and display
the total rainfall, average monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest rainfall.

### Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET 8.0
- Arrays
- Functions/Methods
- Console Application

### Code Snippet

```csharp
static string MonthToWords(int month)
{
    switch (month)
    {
        case 1: return "January";
        case 2: return "February";
        case 3: return "March";
        case 4: return "April";
        case 5: return "May";
        case 6: return "June";
        default: return "Invalid Month";
    }
}
```

### What I Learned

- How to work with arrays in C#
- How to validate user input using TryParse
- How to break a program into multiple functions
- How to find minimum and maximum values in an array

```
