## Project 1: Dua's Snake Game

### Description

A console-based Snake game built in C# where the player controls a snake using arrow keys.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food. The game ends if the snake hits the wall,
bites its own tail, or if the 60 second timer runs out. Includes a main menu, instructions
page, and high score tracker.

### Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET 8.0
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

### Code Snippet

public static void MoveSnake()
{
(int X, int Y) newHeadPosition = (snakeX, snakeY);
snakeBody.Insert(0, newHeadPosition);

    switch (currentDirection)
    {
        case ConsoleKey.UpArrow:    snakeY--; break;
        case ConsoleKey.DownArrow:  snakeY++; break;
        case ConsoleKey.LeftArrow:  snakeX--; break;
        case ConsoleKey.RightArrow: snakeX++; break;
    }

    if (snakeX < 0 || snakeX >= gameAreaWidth ||
        snakeY < 0 || snakeY >= gameAreaHeight)
    {
        isGameOver = true;
    }

}
