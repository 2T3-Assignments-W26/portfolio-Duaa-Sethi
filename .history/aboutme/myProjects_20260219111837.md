## Project 1: Snake Game

### Description

A console-based Snake game built in C#. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

### Technologies Used

- C#
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

### Code Snippet

```csharp
static void DrawSnake()
{
    Console.SetCursorPosition(snake.X, snake.Y);
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
    Console.Write("■");
}

static void CheckCollision()
{
    if (snake.X <= 0 || snake.X >= width ||
        snake.Y <= 0 || snake.Y >= height)
    {
        gameOver = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Game Over!");
    }
}

### What I Learned
- How to use loops and conditionals in C#
- How to manipulate the console display
- How to handle keyboard input for movement
- How game logic and collision detection works
